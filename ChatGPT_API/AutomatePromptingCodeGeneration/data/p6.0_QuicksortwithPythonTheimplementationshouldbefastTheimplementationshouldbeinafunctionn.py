If the length of `arr` is 1 or less, the function simply returns `arr`. Otherwise, it selects the first element of `arr` as the pivot and creates two empty lists `left` and `right`. It then loops through the remaining elements of `arr` and appends them to either `left` or `right` depending on whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. Finally, it returns the concatenation `[funcImp(left), pivot, funcImp(right)]`, where `funcImp(left)` and `funcImp(right)` are recursive calls to the `funcImp` function on the `left` and `right` sublists. This sorts `arr` in ascending order. To sort in descending order, you can simply reverse the output of `funcImp(arr)`.", 'success': True, 'error': None}, {'code': <code object <module> at 0x000001782D3B6B40, file "<string>", line 1>, 'raw': "Here's an implementation of Quicksort in Python that sorts a list of integers in ascending order.

It then moves all elements smaller than the pivot to the left and all elements larger than the pivot to the right. This is done by maintaining two pointers (`i` and `j`) that start at the ends of the list and move towards each other. When the pointers find elements that should be swapped, they swap the elements and continue. When the pointers cross (i.e. `i > j`), the pivot is swapped with the element at index `j`.
