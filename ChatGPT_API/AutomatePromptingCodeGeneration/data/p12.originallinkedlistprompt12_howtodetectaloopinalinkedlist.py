This algorithm uses two pointers, one slow pointer that moves one node at a time and one fast pointer that moves two nodes at a time. If there is a loop in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.\n\nHere\'s how we can implement the `funcImp` function in Python:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp(head):\n    if not head or not head.next:\n        # Empty or single node linked list cannot have a loop\n        return False\n    \n    # Initialize slow and fast pointers\n    slow = head\n    fast = head.next\n    \n    while fast and fast.next:\n        if slow == fast:\n            # Found a loop\n            return True\n        \n        # Move slow and fast pointers\n        slow = slow.next\n        fast = fast.next.next\n    \n    # No loops found\n    return False\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first check if the linked list is empty or has only one node. If it does, there cannot be a loop, so we return `False`.\n\nWe then initialize the slow and fast pointers to the first and second nodes respectively. We then enter a loop that runs until the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list (i.e., `fast` is `None`) or the second-to-last node (i.e., `fast.next` is `None`).\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, we check if `slow` and `fast` are pointing to the same node. If they are, we have found a loop, so we return `True`.\n\nOtherwise, we move the slow pointer by one node and the fast pointer by two nodes. This way, the fast pointer is always "chasing" the slow pointer, and if there is a loop, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.\n\nIf we exit the loop without finding a loop, we return `False`.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the linked list nodes have a `next` attribute that points to the next node in the list.

We start `slow` at the head of the linked list, and `fast` at the second node (if it exists). Then, we enter a while loop that continues as long as `fast` and `fast.next` are not None. Inside the loop, we check if `slow` is equal to `fast`, which means that a loop has been found. If so, we return True.

While "fast" is not None and "fast.next" is not None:\n4. Move "slow" one node at a time by setting "slow" to "slow.next"\n5. Move "fast" two nodes at a time by setting "fast" to "fast.next.next"\n6. If "slow" and "fast" point to the same node (i.e. "slow" == "fast"), then there is a loop in the linked list. Return "True"\n7. If the while loop completes without finding a loop, return "False"\n\nHere is the Python implementation:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImpl(head):\n    slow = head\n    fast = head\n    \n    while fast and fast.next:\n        slow = slow.next\n        fast = fast.next.next\n        if slow == fast:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\nNote: this implementation assumes that the linked list is implemented using a "Node" class with a "next" attribute pointing to the next node in the list.', 'success': True, 'error': None}]
