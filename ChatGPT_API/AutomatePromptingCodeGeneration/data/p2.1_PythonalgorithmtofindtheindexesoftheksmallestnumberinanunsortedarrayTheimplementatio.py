At each iteration, if the current element is smaller than the root of the heap, we remove the root and add the current element to the heap.

At that point, it returns the first k elements of the sorted array (i.e., the k smallest elements).\n\nNote that if you only need the k smallest elements and not their indices, you can directly return the sorted prefix of the array by replacing the last line of `find_k_smallest` with `return sorted(arr[:k])`.", 'success': True, 'error': None}, {'code': <code object <module> at 0x000001782D3B7B80, file "<string>", line 1>, 'raw': 'Here is a Python algorithm to find the indexes of the k smallest numbers in an unsorted array:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp(nums, k):\n    # If k is greater than the length of the list, return an empty list\n    if k > len(nums):\n        return []\n    \n    # Create a list of the first k elements and sort it in ascending order\n    smallest = sorted(nums)[:k]\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store the indexes of the smallest elements\n    indexes = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the list and find the indexes of the smallest elements\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] in smallest:\n            if nums[i] in indexes:\n                indexes[nums[i]].append(i)\n            else:\n                indexes[nums[i]] = [i]\n    \n    # Create a list of the indexes of the smallest elements in ascending order\n    result = []\n    for num in smallest:\n        result.extend(indexes[num])\n        \n    return result\n```\n\nThis algorithm uses the `sorted` function to create a list of the first k smallest elements in the given list.
