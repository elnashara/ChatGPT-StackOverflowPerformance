For each number `num` in the array `arr`, the function checks if its complement has been seen before (i.e., if it's already in the `complements` dictionary). If it has, then `count` is incremented by the number of times the complement has been seen so far. This is because each occurrence of the complement will form a valid pair with `num`.

This is because for each such complement, there are `complements[x]` pairs whose sum equals `target_sum`.\n  - Compute the complement of `x` as `target_sum - x`.\n  - If the complement has been seen before, increment its count in `complements`.\n  - Otherwise, add it to `complements` with an initial count of 1 (because we have seen it only once).\n\nThe time complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because we iterate over each element in the array exactly once.
