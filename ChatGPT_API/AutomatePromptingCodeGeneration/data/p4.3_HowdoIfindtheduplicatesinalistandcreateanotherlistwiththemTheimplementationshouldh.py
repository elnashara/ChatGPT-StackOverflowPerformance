This approach has a time complexity of O(n) in the average case, where n is the length of the input list, because checking membership in a set has an average case time complexity of O(1).\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a list of integers like this:\n\n```Python\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 5, 7, 8, 8]\nduplicates = funcImp(lst)\nprint(duplicates)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 8]\n```\n\nThis will print a list with the duplicate numbers in the input list.

If it hasn't, it is added to `seen`.
