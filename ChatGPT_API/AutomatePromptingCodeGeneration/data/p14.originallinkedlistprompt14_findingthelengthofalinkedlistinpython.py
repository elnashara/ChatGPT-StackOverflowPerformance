I would start by understanding what a linked list is and how it works. I would also refresh my understanding of Python's built-in data structures that can be used to implement a linked list, such as lists and tuples.\n\n2. After understanding how linked lists work, I would look for an approach to traverse the linked list and count the number of nodes. One approach is to start at the head of the linked list and traverse each node, incrementing a counter until the end of the list is reached.\n\n3. I would also consider the time complexity of the algorithm, as I want the fastest possible solution.

This is the best possible time complexity for this problem.\n\n4. When implementing the algorithm, I would start with a function called funcImpl that takes a list as its only parameter. I would check if the list is empty or contains only one node, and return 0 or 1 respectively if that is the case. \n\n5. Next, I would initialize a counter variable to 1 and a current_node variable to the first node of the linked list. I would traverse each node, incrementing the counter variable until the current_node is None. \n\n6.
