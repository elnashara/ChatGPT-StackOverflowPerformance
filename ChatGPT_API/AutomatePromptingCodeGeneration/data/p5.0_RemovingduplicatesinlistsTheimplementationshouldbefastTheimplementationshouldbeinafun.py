This approach has a time complexity of O(n), which is very fast.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `funcImp` function:\n\n```Python\nlst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\nnew_lst = funcImp(lst)\nprint(new_lst)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```", 'success': True, 'error': None}, {'code': <code object <module> at 0x000001782D3B7020, file "<string>", line 1>, 'raw': "Here's one implementation of the `funcImp` function in Python that removes duplicates from a list of integers:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp(nums):\n    return list(set(nums))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `set()` function is used to remove duplicates from the input list `nums`.\n- The resulting set is then converted back into a list using the `list()` function.\n- The function returns this new list without duplicates.\n\nSince set operations are typically O(1) complexity, this implementation should be fast for most input sizes.", 'success': True, 'error': None}, {'code': <code object <module> at 0x000001782D3B7B80, file "<string>", line 1>, 'raw': "Sure, here's a possible implementation in Python that removes duplicates from a list of integers while preserving the order:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp(lst):\n    seen = set()\n    return [x for x in lst if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- We create an empty set `seen` to keep track of the integers we've seen so far.\n- We use a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the input list `lst` in order.\n- For each element `x` of `lst`:\n  - If `x` is already in `seen`, we skip it (i.e., we don't include it in the result list).\n  - If `x` is not in `seen`, we add it to the set and include it in the result list.\n- The final result is a list that contains only the unique elements of `lst`, in the order they appeared.\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because each element is only visited once and set operations (e.g., checking if an element is in a set) have an average time complexity of O(1) in Python.", 'success': True, 'error': None}, {'code': <code object <module> at 0x000001782D3B6A70, file "<string>", line 1>, 'raw': "Here's an implementation in Python using a set to eliminate duplicates:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp(lst):\n    return list(set(lst))\n```\n\nThis implementation first converts the list to a set, which eliminates any duplicates.

This automatically removes any duplicates in the list because dictionaries can only have unique keys. Then, it converts the dictionary back to a list, which preserves the ordering of the original list while removing duplicates.\n\nExample usage:\n```Python\n>>> lst = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 5]\n>>> funcImp(lst)\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```', 'success': True, 'error': None}, {'code': <code object <module> at 0x000001782D3B6E80, file "<string>", line 1>, 'raw': "Here's an implementation of the function `funcImp` which removes duplicates from a list of integers in Python:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp(lst):\n    return list(set(lst))\n```\n\nThis implementation takes advantage of Python's built-in set data type, which doesn't allow duplicates.
