Iterate over the list and add each element as a key in the dictionary with the value as the number of occurrences. Then iterate over the dictionary to create a new list of elements that occurred more than once.\n\nHere's one implementation of a function named `funcImp2` that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef funcImp2(lst):\n    seen = {}\n    duplicates = []\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in seen:\n            if seen[num] == 1:\n                duplicates.append(num)\n            seen[num] += 1\n        else:\n            seen[num] = 1\n    return duplicates\n```\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the size of the list.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
