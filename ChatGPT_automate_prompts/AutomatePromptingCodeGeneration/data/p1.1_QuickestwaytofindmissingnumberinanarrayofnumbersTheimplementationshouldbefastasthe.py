The difference will be the missing number.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function named `funcImpl`:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp2(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    expected_sum = (n+1)*(n+2)//2   #sum of numbers from 1 to n+1\n    actual_sum = sum(arr)\n    return expected_sum - actual_sum\n```\n\nThis function first calculates the expected sum of all sequential numbers from 1 to `n+1`. Then it calculates the actual sum of the numbers in the input list. Subtracting the actual sum from the expected sum will give us the missing number. \n\nNote that this implementation works only if there is exactly one missing number in the input list, and all other numbers are present in the list.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
