We initialize two pointers, `slow_ptr` and `fast_ptr`, both pointing to the head of the linked list. Then, we move the fast pointer twice the speed of the slow pointer. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list, we know that the slow pointer is pointing to the middle element.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `funcImp2` function that finds the middle element in a single traversal:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp2(head):\n    slow_ptr = head\n    fast_ptr = head\n\n    while fast_ptr and fast_ptr.next:\n        slow_ptr = slow_ptr.next\n        fast_ptr = fast_ptr.next.next\n\n    return slow_ptr\n```\n\nIn the above implementation, `head` is the head node of the linked list. We initialize both `slow_ptr` and `fast_ptr` to point to the head. Then, we traverse the linked list using the two-pointer technique until the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list.\n\nIf the length of the linked list is odd, the slow pointer will be pointing to the middle element. If the length of the linked list is even, the slow pointer will be pointing to the second middle element.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
