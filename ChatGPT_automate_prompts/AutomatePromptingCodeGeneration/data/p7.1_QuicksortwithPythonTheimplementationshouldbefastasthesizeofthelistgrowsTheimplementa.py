The function first checks if the list has only one element or less - in this case, the list is already sorted and can be returned as is. Otherwise, the function selects the first element of the list as the pivot, and partitions the remaining elements into two sub-lists, one containing elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater than or equal to the pivot. The function then recursively sorts the two sub-lists and concatenates them along with the pivot to obtain the final sorted list.\n\nThis implementation should be efficient and fast for most cases, as it has an average time complexity of O(n log n) and a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) when the partitioning is very unbalanced. However, in practice quicksort is often faster than other sorting algorithms for most data sets.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
