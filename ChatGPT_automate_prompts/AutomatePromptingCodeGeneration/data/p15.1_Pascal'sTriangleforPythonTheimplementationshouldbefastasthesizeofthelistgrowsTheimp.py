We start with the first row that only contains 1, and then we use dynamic programming to construct each subsequent row. To construct a row, we start with a 1, and then we add the two numbers on either side of the corresponding position in the previous row. We continue adding numbers until we reach the second-to-last position, and then we add a final 1 to complete the row. We repeat this process for the desired number of rows.\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) because we need to calculate each element of Pascal's Triangle once. However, it is still quite fast even for large numbers of rows.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
