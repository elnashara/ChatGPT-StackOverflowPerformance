Here's one possible implementation:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp1(lst):\n    freq = {}\n    for i in lst:\n        if i in freq:\n            freq[i] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[i] = 1\n    return freq\n```\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, making it efficient for large lists. The function takes a single list of integers as a parameter, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the elements in the list, and the values are the frequencies of those elements in the list.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
