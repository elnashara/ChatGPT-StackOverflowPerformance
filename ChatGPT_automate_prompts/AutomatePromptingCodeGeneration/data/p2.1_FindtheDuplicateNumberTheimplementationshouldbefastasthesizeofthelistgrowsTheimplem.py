Then it traverses the list using two runners at different speeds until they meet at a common point (intersection).\n\nAfter finding the intersection point, the function initializes two more pointers `ptr1` and `ptr2` to the first element of the list and the intersection point, respectively. Then it traverses the list using the two pointers until they meet at the duplicate number.\n\nThis algorithm has O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, making it efficient for large lists.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
