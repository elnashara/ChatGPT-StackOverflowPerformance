It uses a 2D list `triangle` to store the values of the triangle, starting with the first row of [1]. It then iterates through each row from index 1 up to `n` minus 1, and for each row it generates a new list `row`, which contains the values for that row. It initializes the first and last values of `row` to 1, and then computes the values for the remaining elements using the values from the previous row. Finally, it appends the completed `row` to `triangle`.\n\nPython's built-in list functions and loop optimization result in this implementation being fairly fast for generating Pascal's Triangle.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
