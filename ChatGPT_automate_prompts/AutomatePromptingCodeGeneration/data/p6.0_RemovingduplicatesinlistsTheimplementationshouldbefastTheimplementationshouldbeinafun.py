Then it converts the set back to a list and returns the result. This code has a time complexity of O(n), making it very fast even for very large lists.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```python\nmyList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7]\nuniqueList = funcImp1(myList)\nprint(uniqueList)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n```\n\nNote that the order of the elements in the output list may not match the order of the input list. If you need to preserve the order, you can use the following implementation instead:\n\n```python\ndef funcImp1(lst):\n    seen = set()\n    return [x for x in lst if x not in seen and not seen.add(x)]\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a set to keep track of which elements have already been seen. It also uses a list comprehension to create the output list, which includes only those elements that have not been seen before. This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) as well.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
