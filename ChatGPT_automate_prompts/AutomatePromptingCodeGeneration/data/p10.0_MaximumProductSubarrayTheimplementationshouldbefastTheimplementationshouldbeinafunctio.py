We start by setting both of them to the first element of the input list. We then update these variables at each index `i` by taking the maximum/minimum of the current element, the maximum/minimum of the product of the current element and the previous `max_product`, and the maximum/minimum of the product of the current element and the previous `min_product`.\n\nFinally, we keep track of the maximum of all maximum product subarrays seen so far in the variable `result`.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) as it iterates through the input list once.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
