We iterate through the array `arr` once, and for each number `num` we check if its complement (`target_sum - num`) is already in the dictionary `complements`. If it is, we add the frequency of the complement to the count. We then update the frequency of the complement in `complements`. If the complement is not in `complements`, we add it with a frequency of 1.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array `arr`. This is the optimal time complexity for this problem, as we need to examine every element of the array at least once.', 'success': True, 'error': None}
