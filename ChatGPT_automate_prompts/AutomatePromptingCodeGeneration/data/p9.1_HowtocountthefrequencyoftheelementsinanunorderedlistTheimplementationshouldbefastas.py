We can loop through the list, and for each element, if it already exists in the dictionary, increment the count by 1. Otherwise, add the element to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `funcImp2` function using this approach:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp2(lst):\n    freq = {}\n    for elem in lst:\n        if elem in freq:\n            freq[elem] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[elem] = 1\n    return freq\n```\n\nThis function works by looping through each element in the list and adding or incrementing a count in the `freq` dictionary. The final result is a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements from the list, and the values are the counts of those elements. \n\nThis implementation should be fast even for large lists since dictionary lookups are typically fast and efficient.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
