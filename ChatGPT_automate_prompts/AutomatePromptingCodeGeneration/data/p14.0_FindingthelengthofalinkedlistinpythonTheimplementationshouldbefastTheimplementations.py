The `head` parameter is the first node of the linked list.\n\nWe then initialize a `count` variable to 0, which will keep track of the length of the linked list. We loop through each node in the linked list using a while loop and increment our `count` variable with each iteration.\n\nFinally, we return the `count` variable once we have finished iterating through the entire linked list.\n\nThis implementation should be efficient, as it only requires a single pass through the linked list and has a time complexity of O(n).", 'success': True, 'error': None}
