It iterates through the list using a `while` loop, starting from the head node and incrementing the `length` variable for each node until the end of the list is reached (i.e., when `current` becomes `None`).\n\nFinally, the function returns the total length of the linked list. This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) since it only needs to traverse the list once.', 'success': True, 'error': None}
