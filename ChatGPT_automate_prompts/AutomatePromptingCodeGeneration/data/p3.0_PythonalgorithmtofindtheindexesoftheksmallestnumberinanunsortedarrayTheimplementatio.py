It then iterates through the values in the sorted list and adds the corresponding indices from the dictionary to a list until the list contains at least k indices. Finally, it returns the first k indices from the list.\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the initial sorting of the unique values in the array. However, it can be faster in practice than other algorithms with the same time complexity, such as sorting the entire array and then taking the first k elements, because it only needs to sort the unique values and can stop iterating once it has found k indices.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
