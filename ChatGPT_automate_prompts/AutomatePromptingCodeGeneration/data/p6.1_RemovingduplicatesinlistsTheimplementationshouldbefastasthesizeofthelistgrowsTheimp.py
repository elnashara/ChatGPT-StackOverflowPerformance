This implementation uses a dictionary to track unique integers in the list, which has a constant time complexity of O(1) for each lookup or insert operation.\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp2(nums):\n    unique_nums = {}\n    result = []\n    for num in nums:\n        if num not in unique_nums:\n            unique_nums[num] = True\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates over the input list once, and performs a constant-time dictionary lookup and potential insert for each integer in the list.\n\nNote: It's important to keep in mind that removing duplicates from a list *in place* (i.e. modifying the original list) can be more memory efficient than creating a new list with only unique elements, but it can also have worse time complexity due to the need for multiple nested loops. If modifying the original list is a requirement, a different implementation may be needed.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
