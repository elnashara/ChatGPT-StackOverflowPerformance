The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) which makes it quite fast.\n\n```python\ndef funcImp1(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    total_sum = sum(arr)\n    expected_sum = (n+1)*(n+2)//2\n    return expected_sum - total_sum\n```\n\nThe idea behind this algorithm is to find the sum of all the numbers in the array and then subtract it from the sum of first n+1 numbers (where n is the length of the array). The difference between these sums will be the missing number. \n\nNote that the formula used to calculate the expected sum is (n+1)*(n+2)//2, which is the sum of first n+1 natural numbers. This formula can be derived using the sum of arithmetic progression formula.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
