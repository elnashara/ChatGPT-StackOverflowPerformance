For each number `num` in the input `arr`, we compute its complement `complement` (i.e., the number that would add up to the `target_sum` if added to `num`). If `complement` has been seen before, then we increment the `pairs_count` by the number of times `complement` has been seen so far. This handles the case where multiple pairs in the input array add up to the `target_sum`. Finally, we add `num` to the hash table with its count (number of occurrences) so that we can use it to compute complements for subsequent numbers. \n\nNote that this implementation performs a single iteration over the input array and has an average time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. It should be reasonably fast for most practical cases.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
