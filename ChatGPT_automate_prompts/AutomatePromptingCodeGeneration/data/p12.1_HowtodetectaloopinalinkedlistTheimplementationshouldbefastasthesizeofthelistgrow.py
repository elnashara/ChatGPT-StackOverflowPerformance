We traverse the linked list with two pointers, one moving one node at a time (slow) and the other moving two nodes at a time (fast). If there is a loop in the linked list, the fast runner will eventually catch up with the slow runner and they will meet at the same node.\n\nHere's the implementation of the funcImp2 function in Python:\n\n```Python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef funcImp2(head: ListNode) -> bool:\n    slow = head\n    fast = head\n    \n    while fast and fast.next:\n        slow = slow.next\n        fast = fast.next.next\n        \n        if slow == fast:\n            return True\n    \n    return False\n```\n\nThe function takes the head of the linked list as a parameter and returns True if there is a loop in the list and False otherwise.\n\nWe start with both pointers at the head of the list. In each iteration, we move the slow runner one node forward and the fast runner two nodes forward. If there is a loop in the linked list, the fast runner will eventually catch up with the slow runner and they will meet at the same node. If there is no loop, the fast runner will reach the end of the list and the while loop will terminate.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
