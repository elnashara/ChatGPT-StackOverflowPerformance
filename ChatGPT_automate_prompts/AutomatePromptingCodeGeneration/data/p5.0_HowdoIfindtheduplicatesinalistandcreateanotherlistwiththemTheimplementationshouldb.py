You can iterate over the input list, adding each element to a dictionary as a key and incrementing its value with each occurrence. Then, you can iterate over the dictionary and add the keys with a value greater than 1 (i.e., the duplicates) to a new list.\n\nHere's an implementation of the above approach:\n\n```Python\ndef funcImp1(lst):\n    count = {}\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in count:\n            count[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count[num] = 1\n    duplicates = [num for num in count if count[num] > 1]\n    return duplicates\n```\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as it only iterates over the list once and uses a dictionary for constant-time lookup and insertion.", 'success': True, 'error': None}
